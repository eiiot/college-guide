# Writing the College Application Essay

> "I try to leave out the parts that people skip."<br/>
> â€” Elmore Leonard

Writing is hard. It's hard for everyone. It's hard for your English teacher. It's hard for your friends. It's hard for your goldfish. It's hard for your pet rock. That's why for most people, it's the longest part of the applications process. 

This doesn't mean it's impossible, or even that it's not fun! There are a bunch of resources that Berkeley High offers to help you with the writing process, and to make sure that you submit the best essays for you.
