# Letters of Reccomendation

Many private colleges (and some public colleges) require letters of reccomendation from counselors and teachers. As soon as you know where you are applying, be sure to check if any schools require letters of reccomendation. If they do, then you will have to ask. **Letters are not written automatically.**

## Completing a Senior Profile

Before asking for letters, please fill out and submit the Senior Profile. This allows teachers to have more information about you and your accomplishments for the letter writing process.

## Asking for Letters

While the way to ask for letters varies by Small School, the common ettequite is generally the same:

1. Don't ask too early. Wait until the fall of your senior year - some small schools (IB) will have specific weeks for asking teachers.
2. Ask in person. Don't ask over email or text.
3. Ask if they can write you a **strong** letter of reccomendation, not if they *can* write you a letter of reccomendation. If they say no, then you might want to ask someone else.

Most colleges require three letters of reccomendation: one from a counselor, one from a STEM teacher, and one from a humanities teacher. Importantly, you **still need to ask your counselor** for a letter. 

### Sample Script

> Hi Mr. Dumbledore, I was wondering - do you think you would be able to write me a strong letter of reccomendation? I've really enjoyed your class and I think you know me well. I've also included my Senior Profile for you to look at. Thank you!
