# Applying to Colleges

Now that you've decided what colleges you're interested in, it's time to apply! This section will cover the basics of applying to colleges, including the different types of applications, the different types of deadlines, and how to apply for financial aid.

## Types of applications

Most colleges have two deadlines for applying: early, and regular. However, within each of those categories, there are many different types of applications.

### Early Action (EA)

**Early action (EA)** applications allow students to submit their applications earlier than the regular submission deadline, typically in October or November. Unlike [early decision](#early-decision-ed) applications, which are binding, early action is **non-binding**, meaning that students are not committed to attend if accepted. The main benefit of applying early action is that students receive admission decisions much sooner, usually by December or January. This can ease stress, allowing students who are accepted to relax or work on other applications, and if denied, focus on other options.

You can apply to as many colleges as you want early action, as long as they are *all* early action. For example, a student might have the following applications:

- 3 early action applications (University of Orgeon, CU Colorado, University of Virginia)
- 5 regular decision applications (University of Washington, University of California Berkeley, University of Michigan, University of Texas, University of Florida)
</Callout>

#### Restrictive Early Action (REA)

**Restrictive Early Action (REA)**, also known as **Single-Choice Early Action (SCEA)**, is a version of Early Action that restricts applicants from applying to other colleges under an early decision or other restrictive early action plan. The key advantage of REA, similar to EA, is the early response from the school, affording relaxed planning and focused preparation based on the outcome. However, unlike EA applications, REA demands a well-researched and deliberate first college choice as options for early applications are limited.

Restrictions on REA vary by school. For example, Stanford's REA policy states that students may not apply to any other private college or university under their early admission program, but may apply to any public institution's regular admission program. On the other hand, Yale's REA policy states that students may not apply to any other private college or university under their early admission program, or to any public institution's early admission program.

An example of a student's REA applications might be:

- 1 restrictive early action application (Stanford University)
- 2 early action applications (University of Orgeon, CU Colorado) (both public schools)
- 5 regular decision applications

However, a different student might have the following applications:

- 1 restrictive early action application (Yale University)
- 5 regular decision applications
</Callout>

### Early Decision (ED)

**Early Decision (ED)** is a binding college admission process where high school students apply to their first-choice college earlier than the regular admission deadline, typically by November of their senior year. Because ED is **binding**, if a student is accepted through ED, they **MUST** attend that college, and often rescend all other applications[^1].

Because ED is so strict, and you can only choose ONE ED college, it's only a good idea if the college meets the following criteria:

1. It's your first choice college
2. You're sure you can afford it

If you're not sure about either of these, it's probably a better idea to apply regular decision or EA if the college offers it.

An example of a student's ED application might be:

- 1 early decision application (Harvard University)
- 5 regular decision applications
</Callout>

### Regular Decision (RD)

**Regular Decision (RD)** is the standard college application process, where students apply by the regular deadline, typically in January of their senior year. Students who apply regular decision will receive their admission decisions in March or April, and have until May 1st to decide which college to attend. Most students apply to most colleges RD.

### Other Admissions Plans

Some colleges have an **ED II** plan, which is similar to ED, but with a later deadline. ED II is typically due in January, and students receive their decisions in February. ED II is a good option for students who didn't get into their ED college, or who didn't apply ED in the first round.

Some colleges also have a **rolling admissions** plan, where students can apply at any time, and receive their decisions within a few weeks. Rolling admissions is a good option for students who are applying late, or who want to get their decisions as soon as possible.

[^1]: Often, this means sitting down with a councellor and manually rescending all other applications. This is a big deal - if you forget to rescend an application, you can get in trouble with your ED college, and can even have your admission rescended.

## Deadlines

Most colleges feature one of three main deadlines:

- Early Applications are usually due ~November 1st, and students receive their decisions in December or January.
- The UC Application is usually due ~November 30th, and students receive their decisions in March or April.
- Regular Applications are usually due ~January 1st, and students receive their decisions in March or April.
