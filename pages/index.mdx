The college application process generally takes place over three parts:

Applying to colleges is the process of actually submitting your applications. This is often the most confusing part of the process, as there are so many moving parts: writing essays, figuring out each individual applications, understanding your transcript, etc. To learn more about applying, check out these pages:

### Decide

After your applications are in, you can relax, at least for a bit. As colleges begin to reply back with offers, you have the task of figuring out where you'll end up next year.
