# About Us

Our methodology for this site was simple: create the most comprehensive guide to the college admissions process possible! While much of the advice featured is from our own experiences during the college applications process, we also interviewed a lot of people to get their thoughts. Additional information was gathered from interviews with the CCC, Admissions Officers[^1], Private College Counselors, teachers, and other students.

Created by students, for students.
